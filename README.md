ZeoSleepMonitor
===============

This is basically a reimplementation of the Smart Wake feature that was supposed to already be part of Zeo Mobile for Android. Smart Wake is supposed to wake you up in at the optimum time in your sleep cycle (entering or leaving REM sleep). However after using Zeo for several months I never saw this feature work.
